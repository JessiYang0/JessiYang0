## **Long intro**

📔 During my internship and employment at TSMC, I learned about the AI technologies and methods that can be applied in the industry, such as machine failure prediction and optimization of machine parameters

📗During my master's program, I authored two papers on AI applications in the industry and participated in industry-academic collaborations, assisting a power company with data visualization and distribution decisions.

🖌️ I applied the R language for feature engineering and data visualization techniques to predict hospital patient readmissions. For the latter, I implemented an attention-based model in Python for text classification.
