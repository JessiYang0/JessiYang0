## **Long intro**

Hi there 👋! I am Claudia, a hearing impaired (🦻) community builder and founder, who wants to make the tech industry more accessible and inclusive.
The last five years I have been building <a href="https://womendotcode.be" target="_blank">women.code(be)</a>, **a supportive network for women who code, who are living in Belgium**. 

Thanks to my prior career experiences in tech I have been doing a lot of different things that allowed me to grow women.code(be) into the community that it is today. I did everything from web development (mostly specialised in frontend), design (UX / UI) to product management.
 
Since 2023, I am also the **chairwoman** of <a href="https://fronteers.nl" target="_blank">Fronteers</a>, a Dutch organisation and community who are commited to professionalise the function of front-end developers.

Occassionally, you might also run into me at a <a href="https://fronteersbe.github.io" target="_blank">Fronteers meetup</a> , as I am currently the main **organiser Fronteers Belgium**. I still love being actively involved in the local front-end community, even though I am currently more of a hobby developer. 😊

During the (work)day however, it is more likely that you'll find me representing BeCode - a Belgian coding school with 4 different campuses across Belgium - as community lead. Originally, I started at BeCode as career coach (often also called talent coach), with as main focus supporting and guiding bootcamp students, so they could start their career in tech with confidence.
