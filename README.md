## **Long intro**

🪽 I am deeply interested in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Deep Learning**, **Machine Learning**, **Time-Series Processing**, **Computer Vision**, and **Natural Language Processing**, with prior research experience in Time-Series Prediction. My mission is to develop AI solutions to assist power companies in making electricity supply decisions.

📗During my master's program, I authored two papers on AI applications in the industry and participated in industry-academic collaborations, assisting a power company with data visualization and distribution decisions.

🖌️ I applied the R language for feature engineering and data visualization techniques to predict hospital patient readmissions. For the latter, I implemented an attention-based model in Python for text classification.

📔 During my internship and employment at TSMC, I learned about the AI technologies and methods that can be applied in the industry, such as machine failure prediction and optimization of machine parameters
